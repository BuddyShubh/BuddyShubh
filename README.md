   responsive web applications that provide an excellent user
   experience.

## Tech Stack

Here's a quick rundown of the technologies and tools I frequently use:

1.  **ReactJS:** I leverage ReactJS for building interactive user interfaces. Its component-based architecture allows me to create modular and reusable code, facilitating efficient development.
    
2.  **Next.js:** For server-side rendering and a seamless development experience, I often turn to Next.js. It helps me build performant web applications with ease, providing features like automatic code splitting and hot module replacement.
    
3.  **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform):** Animations play a crucial role in enhancing user engagement, and GSAP is my go-to choice for creating smooth and captivating animations. It offers a robust set of tools for animating anything from simple UI elements to complex graphics.
    
4.  **Firebase:** Firebase is an excellent platform for building and scaling web applications quickly. I use Firebase for real-time database management, authentication, and hosting. Its ease of use allows me to focus more on the application's functionality.
    
5.  **PostgreSQL:** As a reliable and powerful relational database system, PostgreSQL is my preferred choice for handling data in web applications. It ensures data integrity and provides advanced features for complex queries and transactions.
